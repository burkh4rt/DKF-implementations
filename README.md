## DKF Implementations

*This repository contains code implementations for the Discriminative Kalman Filter.*

We currently offer example code for filtering using the following languages:
- Matlab
- Python
- R

Contributions are welcome!

The data consists of run 1 from the pre-processed Flint data found in [burkh4rt/Discriminative-Kalman-Filter](https://github.com/burkh4rt/Discriminative-Kalman-Filter).
