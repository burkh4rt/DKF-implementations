## DKF Implementations

_This repository contains code implementations for the Discriminative Kalman
Filter. [^1][^2][^3][^4] _

We currently offer example code for filtering using the following languages:

- Julia
- Matlab
- Python
- R

The data consists of run 1 from the pre-processed Flint data found in
[burkh4rt/Discriminative-Kalman-Filter](https://github.com/burkh4rt/Discriminative-Kalman-Filter).
